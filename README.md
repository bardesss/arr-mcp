# arr-mcp

One MCP server for your whole self-hosted media stack — not one per service.

Ask questions no single service can answer. *"Why isn't the film I requested on
Tuesday showing up in Jellyfin?"* spans Seerr, Radarr, Prowlarr, SABnzbd and
Jellyfin. arr-mcp correlates them and gives you the causal chain.

- **A web config page** that diagnoses connections instead of printing
  pass/fail, and shows live logs while you debug.
- **Tool output is treated as untrusted data, never instruction.** Release names
  from public indexers are attacker-controllable and flow straight into model
  context; arr-mcp fences them.
- **Safe by default.** Deletion is off until you deliberately enable it, and
  then still asks per call.

> ### Status: 0.1 walking skeleton
>
> Radarr and a single `stack_health` tool. Not yet useful — this is the
> foundation the rest lands on. See [the roadmap](#roadmap).

## Planned services

Radarr · Sonarr · Prowlarr · Bazarr · Jellyfin · Seerr · SABnzbd · Transmission

## Quick start

Not yet — there is no published image until 0.1.0 ships. Once it does:

```yaml
services:
  arr-mcp:
    image: ghcr.io/bardesss/arr-mcp:latest
    ports: ['6060:6060']
    volumes: ['./config:/config']
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The bearer token for the MCP endpoint is generated on first run and printed to
the container log. Until the config UI lands in 0.5, edit
`config/config.yaml` by hand and **restart the container** to pick up changes.

## Roadmap

| Version | Delivers |
| --- | --- |
| 0.1 | Walking skeleton: stateless MCP transport, bearer auth, Radarr, `stack_health` |
| 0.2 | The remaining seven service adapters and 11 read tools |
| 0.3 | Cross-service correlation: identity resolver, three-way library join, `diagnose` |
| 0.4 | Writes: permission tiers, `dry_run`, write audit, per-call confirmation |
| 0.5 | Web config page: dashboard, diagnosing connection tests, log streams |
| 0.6 → 1.0 | Metadata providers, MCP resources and prompts |

Each version is a self-contained, shippable slice — the goal is that 0.3 already
answers questions no individual service can, with 0.4–0.6 making it complete.

## Requirements

- A LAN-reachable install of at least one supported service
- Docker, or Node 24+ to run from source
- An MCP client speaking protocol revision `2026-07-28`

## Security

arr-mcp is **not designed to be exposed to the internet.** The `/mcp` endpoint
requires a bearer token because "LAN-only" is a network assumption rather than a
security control — the endpoint fronts up to eight API keys and, once enabled,
file deletion, and a home network contains guest phones and IoT devices.

## Thanks

arr-mcp is glue. The hard parts belong to other people.

**The services it speaks to** — none of this exists without them, and every one
is free software maintained largely by volunteers:

[Radarr](https://radarr.video) · [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv) ·
[Prowlarr](https://prowlarr.com) · [Bazarr](https://www.bazarr.media) ·
[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) ·
[Seerr](https://github.com/seerr-team/seerr) · [SABnzbd](https://sabnzbd.org) ·
[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com)

**The libraries it is built on:**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) | the protocol, and a stateless transport that made this simple |
| [Hono](https://hono.dev) | the HTTP server |
| [Zod](https://zod.dev) | config validation and tool input schemas |
| [Pino](https://getpino.io) | logging |
| [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) | tests |
| [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) | the log ring buffer and write audit |
| [yaml](https://eemeli.org/yaml/) | reading `config.yaml` |
| [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) | the language |

If you find arr-mcp useful, consider supporting the services above first.
